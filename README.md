# Crossover SMAs Crypto Trading Algorithm

This project demonstrates a simple **Moving Average Crossover Strategy** using Python.  
It uses historical Bitcoin data, calculates two Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), generates trading signals based on crossovers, and compares the performance of the strategy to a simple Buy-and-Hold approach.

The purpose of this project is to showcase data analysis and basic algorithmic trading logic using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **yfinance**.

---

## Features

- Fetch historical Bitcoin price data using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)  
- Calculate and visualize 9-day and 30-day Simple Moving Averages  
- Generate Buy/Sell signals based on SMA crossovers  
- Backtest the strategy against a Buy & Hold benchmark  
- Display results with professional charts
